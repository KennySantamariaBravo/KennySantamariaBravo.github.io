        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a freshman at the University of California, Riverside, I am currently working toward my Business Finance degree, driven by a strong passion for financial management, investing, and entrepreneurship. My goal is to build a career that blends strategic financial planning with real-world business experience, helping individuals and businesses grow their wealth efficiently. I have always been fascinated by the way financial decisions impact both individuals and corporations, and I aspire to work in areas such as investment banking, wealth management, or even starting my financial consulting firm in the future.
<br><br>

        Beyond academics, I have already taken steps to gain hands-on experience in the business world. I work as a life insurance agent, helping clients secure their financial futures through tailored policies. This role has allowed me to develop valuable skills in sales, communication, and financial planning, as I guide individuals and families through the process of choosing policies that best suit their needs. Additionally, I run a clothing sales business, where I manage everything from sourcing inventory to marketing and customer service. Running my own business has given me insight into branding, market trends, and customer psychology, all of which are essential for success in any industry. One of my long-term career goals is to create multiple streams of income, whether through business ownership, investments, or real estate. I strongly believe in financial independence and want to build wealth not just for myself, but also to help others do the same. I envision myself eventually launching a consulting firm that provides financial literacy education to young entrepreneurs and professionals, equipping them with the knowledge to make smarter financial decisions.<br><br>

        Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I enjoy immersing myself in car culture by attending car meets and participating in races. I have always had a passion for cars, from modifying them to understanding their mechanics, and the thrill of racing keeps me motivated and competitive. In many ways, this passion for cars ties into my love for businessâ€”I see the automotive industry as another area where I could explore opportunities, whether it be through investments, car flipping, or even starting an automotive-related business in the future. In addition to cars, basketball is another major part of my life. Whether itâ€™s playing in a competitive setting or just shooting hoops with friends, basketball teaches me discipline, teamwork, and perseveranceâ€”skills that are equally important in business. The sport has shaped my mindset, teaching me that hard work and consistency pay off in the long run, a lesson I apply to my studies and business ventures. Looking ahead, I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skill set in finance, sales, and entrepreneurship. I want to gain more hands-on experience through internships, networking with professionals in the finance and business world, and possibly even launching another business venture. With a deep interest in financial growth, business strategy, and wealth creation, I constantly seek opportunities to learn, adapt, and innovate. My ambition is to build a career that not only brings me personal success but also allows me to help others achieve financial stability and independence.
